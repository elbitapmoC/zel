      <h4 class="case__section-heading">The Result</h4>

        With success and popularity of online shopping, those of us with retail business ideas don’t need to open up a storefront.<br/><br/>

        For starters, cost is much cheaper, if you can manage the work there’s no need to higher employees, no rental fees, monthly electricity bill, etc.<br/><br/>
        
        In addition, there’s no crowds to navigate aroung or lines to wait in, find what you want online and items arrive in days.

        It’s important to find out about our target audience before we start designing and selling.<br/><br/> 
        
        Is there a market for this? Do people want it? Is this possible to make? Who/where is our audience?

        Now that we know who we’re looking to engage with, it’s a good time to look into their habits as customers.<br/><br/>

        It’s important to understand millenials are looking for value and convenience, something that’s relatable.<br/><br/>
        
        Convenience, one of the reasons many of us do food delivery services or order take out over instead of spending 30 minutes in the kitchen.<br/><br/>
        
        The convenience of having the internet inside the palm of your pocket. In todays digitally connected world, shoppers(millenials especially) are more likely to purchase items online.

        Since it was primarily me as the visual designer and time needed to be used wisely I quickly drew up a wireframe on pen and paper before making a mid-fi interactive prototype.<br><br>

      <h4 class="case__section-heading">Usability Testing</h4>

        I conducted usabilitiy interviews with 5 students around college campus and asked them to invite a friend who likes shopping online to use and interact with our prototype.

          <li>The about section was looked over more than I expected, I replaced the about section with a quick bottom nav link to our profile.</li>
          <li>The shop button confused users with checking to see what’s in the cart.</li>
          <li>Users enjoyed the menu and how they didn’t have to use two hands to hold the phone.</li>
